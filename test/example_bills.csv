Allows grantees to use the grant to provide counseling without testing. <p>Requires applicants who regularly provide treatment for sexually transmitted diseases or for intravenous substance abuse and applicants who are family planning clinics or tuberculosis clinics to routinely test for infection with the etiologic agent for AIDS. <p>Prohibits the Secretary from making a grant to a State unless the State requires testing of each individual who is convicted of prostitution, a crime relating to sexual assault, or a crime relating to intravenous drug abuse. Requires the State to test certain individuals on entering the penal system and during the 30-day period preceding their release. Requires the State to notify the individual before the test is performed. Requires, on request of a victim of a crime relating to sexual assault, that the victim be notified of the results of the testing.

Authorizes payment through the Veterans Administration (VA) for such training at 80 percent of the basic full-time monthly rate otherwise payable, with the member's educational assistance entitlement charged accordingly. <p>Eliminates the reference to a high school equivalency certificate (as a requirement for eligibility for educational benefits under the Montgomery GI Bill), instead requiring that an individual have certain alternate school credentials accepted by the armed forces, pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Defense, which are equivalent to a secondary school diploma. <p>Provides that a person who receives an early discharge from service for a preexisting medical condition which the Administrator of Veterans Affairs determines is not service-connected and, as a result of such discharge or release, does not meet the length-of-service requirements for entitlement to educational assistance, shall be entitled to receive military pay equal to the entire amount of his or her military pay reduction previously taken for participation in such program, less any inservice educational assistance received before such release or discharge. <p>Authorizes an individual who is eligible for educational assistance and who is separated from service prior to the completion of his or her four-year Selected Reserve obligation due to disability, hardship, or the convenience of the Government, to elect whether he or she wants to receive entitlement based on two years of active-duty obligation or to receive such entitlement based on four years of Selected Reserve duty. <p>Authorizes the use of nonpay work training programs for veterans in State or local government agencies (currently, such veterans may only obtain such nonpay work training programs through Federal agencies), supported in whole or in part with Federal funding, to provide appropriate training or work experience for an eligible service-disabled veteran under the veterans' vocational rehabilitation program.  Requires the VA to promulgate regulations to monitor and guard against abuse of such free resource by the employing agency and to ensure that such training is in the best interest of the veterans and the Federal Government. <p>Limits the amount of educational assistance payable to a veteran under the post-Vietnam Era Veterans' Educational Assistance program when such veterans are incarcerated in a Federal, State, or local penal institution for conviction of a felony. Reduces such amount to the lesser of the amount otherwise payable or the established charges for tuition, fees, and necessary books, supplies, and equipment.  Reduces such amount further to the extent tuition and fees are paid under other non-VA governmental programs. <p><b>Title II:  Administrative Provisions</b> - Revises current Federal provisions which provide for the measurement of certain unit courses or subjects pursued by veterans toward a standard college degree to measure such course enrollment by converting the credit hours being pursued to equivalent clock hours, and combining this number with the actual number of clock hours concurrently pursued, if any, to determine appropriate training time to be credited to such veterans. <p>Extends through December 31, 1993, the Veterans' Advisory Committee on Education. <p>Amends various veterans' educational assistance provisions to permit eligible veterans to receive payment for the pursuit of remedial, refresher, or deficiency courses, with an appropriate charge to that individual's total educational assistance entitlement. <p>Provides that certain individuals' entitlement to educational assistance will be computed from the date of first entry on active duty.  (Currently, the entitlement period begins on the period after the individual's basic pay is reduced for such educational assistance.) <p>Provides for a proportionate reduction in educational assistance entitlement in accordance with the reduction in monthly educational assistance allowance paid when a veteran pursuing an apprenticeship or other on-the-job training program fails to work at least 120 hours in a month.  Provides the same proportionate reduction for educational assistance benefits under the post-Vietnam Era Educational Assistance program for failure to complete 120 hours of apprenticeship or other on-the-job training in a month. <p>Requires the Assistant Secretary for Force Management and Personnel to be an ex officio member of the Commission to Assess Veterans' Education Policy."

Directs the Secretary concerned to require:  (1) an applicant for appointment as a cadet or midshipman to undergo such testing during the physical examination given such individual before such appointment; and (2) any person offered a commission to undergo such testing during the precommission physical. Authorizes the President to suspend such testing requirements in time of war or emergency as declared by the Congress or the President. <p>Prohibits the Secretary of the Air Force, in accepting persons for original enlistment in the Regular Air Force, from:  (1) setting a minimum or maximum percentage of persons who may be accepted for such an enlistment according to gender for skill categories or jobs; or (2) in any other way basing the acceptance of a person for such an enlistment on gender.  Directs the Secretary to develop a methodology for implementing the above provision, and repeals a specified provision of the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1985 requiring a specified percentage of Air Force enlistees to be women. <p>Provides that a civilian technician of the Army National Guard whose military occupational specialty has been approved for training by a National Guard school of that technician's State shall receive training in such specialty through his or her State school instead of through the Military Education Program.

(Currently, such preference is limited to levels above GS-1 level.) <p>Reduces from 90 days to 30 days the time that must elapse after the Secretary submits a manpower estimate to the defense committees before the Secretary may approve the full-scale engineering development of a major defense acquisition program.  Waives such required period during time of war or national emergency declared by the Congress or the President. Reduces such period to 10 days if such estimate indicates that no increase in military or civilian end strength will be required. <p><b>Title VI:  Compensation and Other Personnel Benefits - Part A: Pay and Allowances</b> - Waives Federal provisions requiring military compensation increases in conformity with GS-level increases in the Federal Government, instead authorizing the following increases effective January 1, 1989:  (1) a 4.1 percent increase in the rates of basic pay and basic allowance for subsistence; (2) a seven percent increase in the rates of the basic allowance for quarters; and (3) a 4.1 percent increase in cadet and midshipman pay.

Directs the Under Secretary to ensure that the program management and acquisition plan for each major defense acquisition program and for any other such program as designated by the Under Secretary for the Department of Defense (DOD) provides for a continuing analysis of all factors that affect the capability of the defense industrial base to manufacture the system required under such program, as well as to maintain such system during its service life.  Requires the Under Secretary to be responsible for compiling and analyzing all data obtained in order to ensure that the U.S. industrial defense base capabilities for such major defense acquisition programs have been assessed by the military department or defense agency involved and by the Office of the Secretary of Defense. <p>Directs the Secretary of each military department and the head of each defense agency to identify items of supply that are suitable substitutes for standard military supply items and that are readily available commercially, and to plan for the procurement of such substitute supply items.  Directs the Under Secretary to monitor any such action taken by either the Secretary of the military department involved or the head of the defense agency involved. Directs the Secretary of the military department involved or the head of each defense agency to prepare and maintain inventory records of all Government-owned industrial plant equipment furnished to a contractor by such military department or defense agency.  Directs such Secretary or the head of such agency, in furnishing equipment to contractors, to give preference to each manufacturer or producer who has entered into an agreement with such Secretary or defense agency head to expand production of supplies and equipment in the event of war or other national emergency. <p>Directs the Secretary of each military department and the head of each defense agency to restrict to domestic firms the competition for all or a portion of a contract opportunity to fulfill such department's or agency's requirements for material, components, or supply items that are products of an emerging technology as listed under this Act.  Directs the Under Secretary, in consultation with the above officials, to ensure that the procurement authority exercised above is only in connection with a coordinated program that provides for the support and development of emerging technologies by domestic firms.  Directs the Under Secretary to publish in a specified Federal publication a list of the emerging technologies that, upon development, will substantially enhance the capabilities of the U.S. industrial base to meet national security requirements. <p>Authorizes the Secretary of each military department and the head of each defense agency to: (1) restrict to domestic firms the competition for contract opportunities to fulfill such department's or agency's requirements for the procurement of critical supply items, under a specified condition; (2) award a contract in any fiscal year for the procurement of a critical supply item to a contractor that manufactures or produces such item in the United States, under a specified condition; and (3) award more than one contract for the procurement of a critical supply item if doing so is necessary to ensure that at least some percentage of the items to be supplied is manufactured in the United States. <p>Outlines specifications to be included in each solicitation issued by a military department or defense agency for the procurement of a weapon system or other item of equipment pursuant to a major defense acquisition program, with regard to critical supply items needed in connection with such program, requiring a minimum percentage, stated on the basis of cost, of such items to be furnished by one or more domestic firms as opposed to awarding the entire contract to a foreign firm.  Requires any foreign firm receiving a major defense or weapon system contract to follow provisions in such contract requiring a specified percentage of the supply items to be used in such contract to be produced in the United States.  Directs the Under Secretary, for purposes of these provisions, to determine what items of supply are critical items and to publish a list of such items in a specified DOD publication. <p>Authorizes the Secretary of each military department and the head of each defense agency to provide a preference to each domestic firm which is designated by such Secretary or agency head as a planned source of item procurement in time of war or other national emergency, within a specified limitation. <p>Directs the Secretary of each military department and the head of each defense agency, with respect to each major defense acquisition program conducted by such agency or department, and any other acquisition program designated to such department or agency  by the Secretary of Defense, to ensure that, to the maximum extent practicable, the acquisition plan provides for contract solicitations to include provisions which encourage competing offerors to acquire, for utilization in the performance of the contract, modern production equipment that increases the productivity of the offerors.  Outlines information to be contained in contract solicitation provisions regarding such acquisition plans. <p>Directs the Secretary of Defense, with the prior approval of the Attorney General, to approve any joint program agreement entered into by two or more domestic firms for the purpose of carrying out a research and development program utilizing emerging technologies or advanced manufacturing technology in ways that enhance the defense industrial base. Directs the Under Secretary to ensure that such program is coordinated with other defense industrial base programs. <p>Expresses the findings of the Congress that certain acts (unfair trade practices, violations of certain export agreements, or false certifications concerning the foreign content of a supply item), whether committed by a domestic or foreign firm, will indicate a lack of business honesty or integrity on the part of such firm, and will allow for the authorization of trade suspension or debarment procedures, as specified under this Act, against a contractor.  Authorizes the Secretary of a military department or the head of a defense agency, in cases of the interests of vital U.S. defense, to waive such provision and award a contract to a subcontractor or contractor who has been suspended or debarred.  Directs the Secretary to provide for clauses in licensing agreements between a domestic and a foreign firm relating to the assurance of contract performance, and for the payment of liquidated damages for any breach of the licensing agreement by such foreign firms.  Provides for the deposit of liquidated damages paid to the United States. <p>Provides that funds appropriated for procurement for the military departments and defense agencies for FY 1989 through 1991 shall be available to the Secretary to carry out the DOD Manufacturing Technology program during such fiscal years, in specified amounts, and to carry out the DOD Industrial Modernization Incentives program for such fiscal years, in specified amounts. <p>Prohibits the head of a defense agency from procuring machine tools manufactured in whole or in part outside the United States, with specified exceptions (relating to the ease of acquiring or producing such items within the United States)."

(Current law imposes such duties on the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) and agency heads but not on the President.)  Specifies that such requirement shall not be construed as requiring the approval of the intelligence committees to initiate such activities. <p>Requires the President to ensure that any illegal intelligence activity is reported to the intelligence committees, as well as any corrective action taken or planned in connection with such illegal activity.  (Current law imposes this duty only on the DCI and agency heads, subject to certain conditions.) <p>Provides statutory authority for the President to authorize covert actions only when he determines such activities are necessary to support U.S. foreign policy objectives and are important to national security.  (Current law does not provide express statutory authorization for covert actions.)

Prohibits a finding from authorizing any covert action that has already occurred or any action that would violate any U.S. statute. <p>Requires the President to ensure that any such finding be reported to the intelligence committees as soon as possible, but no later than 48 hours after it has been signed.  Allows the President, on occasions when time is of the essence, to direct that special activities be initiated prior to reporting such activities to the intelligence committees, provided that notice is provided to the intelligence committees as soon as possible but in no event later than 48-hours after the finding authorizing such activities is signed or the determination to conduct such activities is made. <p>Allows the President, in extraordinary circumstances, to limit the reporting of such findings or determinations to the chairmen and ranking minority members of the intelligence committees, the Speaker and minority leader of the House of Representatives, and the majority and minority leaders of the Senate, but requires that he provide a statement of the reasons for limiting access. <p>Requires the President to promptly notify the intelligence committees or, if applicable, the Members of Congress specified of any significant change in any previously-approved covert actions. <p>Defines ""covert action"" as activities conducted by an element of the U.S. Government to influence political, economic, or military conditions abroad so that the role of the U.S. Government is not intended to be apparent or acknowledged publicly.

(Current law requires all of an HMO's services to be provided through such sources.)  Requires, when employee benefit plans allow employees a choice between two types of HMOs (described in current law), that: (1) one type provide at least 90 percent of its basic health services through physicians associated with such sources; and (2) the other type provide not more than ten percent of its basic health services through physicians not associated with such sources. <p>Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to issue regulations stating the circumstances under which the Secretary will consider the resources of an organization which owns or controls an HMO when evaluating the fiscal soundness of the HMO.

Requires an HMO which uses this option for fixing payment rates, on request, to disclose the method and data used in calculating the payment rates. <p>Revises provisions relating to employees' health benefit plans to make those provisions applicable to employees of States or political subdivisions as well as to employees of private employers. Requires, for health benefits plans which include contributions for services, that the employer or State make contributions under plans for services offered by HMOs in an amount which does not financially discriminate against an employee who enrolls in an HMO. <p>Declares that provisions concerning financial discrimination shall not be construed to supersede collective bargaining agreements in effect on the date of enactment of this Act. <p>Repeals, seven years after this Act's enactment, the requirement that employee health benefit plans include the option of membership in an HMO.

Waives from liability for such loan fee the survivor of any veteran who died from a service-connected disability, including death while in the active military service. <p>Revises the maximum (and minimum) amount of a home loan guaranteed by the United States to a veteran to make such maximum:  (1) 50 percent of the total loan in the case of any loan of not more than $45,000; and (2) 40 percent of the loan or $36,000, whichever is less, in the case of a loan of more than $45,000, but not less than $22,500.  Reduces all such loan amounts by any  entitlement already used by such veteran and not repaid. <p>Revises the amount of a guaranteed loan for the purchase of manufactured homes to a maximum of 40 percent of the loan (currently 50 percent) or $20,000, whichever is less, reduced by any entitlement received and not repaid by the veteran involved.  Prohibits the  amount of any loan guaranteed under such provision from exceeding 95 percent of the purchase price of the property securing the loan. <p>Increases from $27,500 to $36,000 the amount of a direct loan permitted to a veteran for the purchase or construction of a home. <p>Directs the Administrator, upon notice of foreclosure on a veteran's guaranteed housing loan, to contact the veteran with information  concerning:  (1) alternatives to foreclosure; and (2) the veteran's and the VA's liability with respect to the loan in event of foreclosure.  Waives such requirement if the lender has a record of consistently supplying veterans with such information.  Revises provisions relating to the total indebtedness incurred by a veteran as the result of foreclosure proceedings, and the determination of the foreclosure date when delays in such accounting date are caused by either the holder of the loan or the VA (and not by the veteran).  Adds to the total liability of the United States (in a defaulted loan procedure) any interest which accrues on the outstanding loan which comes about as the result of a delay caused by the VA in the liquidation sale of the property securing the loan, or by the voluntary commencement of bankruptcy proceedings. <p>Authorizes the Administrator, during FY 1988 through 1990, to provide VA financing of not more than 65 percent nor less than 50 percent of properties sold by the VA after acquiring them in guaranteed loan defaults. (Currently, such percentages are 75 and 60, respectively.) Limits the amount of a loan made by the Administrator to finance the purchase of such real property to 95 percent of its  purchase price.  Waives such 95 percent cap in certain instances.  Authorizes the Administrator to include, as part of such a loan, an amount to be used only to rehabilitate such property. Directs the Administrator, by March 1, 1990, to transmit to the Congress a report on the implementation of such loan program. <p>Repeals the requirement that a veteran refinancing a VA guaranteed home or manufactured housing loan must still occupy the property securing the loan.  Provides that, for VA housing loan purposes, a person on active duty in the armed forces will be deemed to occupy a property if his or her spouse occupies such property.  Limits a loan to refinance an existing mortgage loan to 90 percent of the appraised value of the dwelling or farm residence which will secure the loan. <p>Provides that, in any case in which a veteran is in an active-duty status and is unable to occupy a property because of such status, any occupancy requirements under the veterans' home loan guaranty program shall be considered to be satisfied if the veteran's spouse occupies such property as the spouse's home and the spouse makes any required certifications. <p>Authorizes the Administrator to enter into agreements to sell properties acquired by the VA under home loan default for use as shelters for homeless veterans and their families.  Limits the sale of such properties to certain approved organizations or to political subdivisions. Authorizes the Administrator to enter into such sales agreements only if:  (1) the Administrator determines that such sale will not adversely affect the VA's goals or programs or the solvency of the Loan Guaranty Revolving Fund; (2) the entity which purchases the property agrees to utilize it solely as a shelter primarily for homeless veterans and their families, to comply with all zoning requirements, and to make no incompatible use of the purchased property; and (3) the Administrator determines that there is little likelihood of the property's being sold for a price sufficient to reduce the liability of the VA or of the veteran who defaulted on the guaranteed loan. <p>Authorizes the Administrator to sell properties acquired by the VA under the home loan program to persons or entities who agree to employ veterans in a job training  program under the Veterans' Job Training Act (VJTA).  Requires the sale amount to be not less than 75 percent of the fair market value of such real property and improvements.  Requires the purchaser to:  (1) agree to use veterans in a VJTA program to rehabilitate the properties; and (2) provide veterans with a preference in the resale of such properties after such rehabilitation.  Reduces the liability of a veteran whose former home is sold under this authority by an amount equal to the reduction in the sale price of the property below the fair market value of the property. Directs the Administrator, by March 1, 1990, to report to the Congress on this program. <p>Provides that, if a veteran disposes of residential property securing a housing loan guaranteed by the VA, and the veteran notifies the holder of the loan in advance before such disposal, the veteran shall be relieved of all further liability to the Administrator on account of such loan (including liability for any loss resulting from the default of any subsequent purchaser) if:  (1) the loan is current; (2) the purchaser agrees to abide by the original loan agreement; and (3) the purchaser qualifies from a credit standpoint in an amount equal to the unpaid balance of the loan.  Requires the holder, if the loan is not current or the purchaser does not meet credit requirements, to notify the veteran and the Administrator, and to notify the veteran also that he or she may appeal such determination to the Administrator.  Directs the Administrator, upon request of the veteran,  to review such determination and make his or her own determination on the matter. <p>Requires the holder to approve such a loan assumption if the Administrator determines the loan is current and that the new purchaser is qualified. Authorizes the Administrator to direct the holder to approve the assumption of a loan, even when the purchaser does not meet the necessary requirements, if the Administrator determines:  (1) that the transferor is unable to make loan payments and has made reasonable efforts to find a buyer who meets all the requirements; (2) that the transferor has requested, within a specified period of time, that the Administrator approve the loan assumption; and (3) that the transferor has agreed to become secondarily liable on the loan upon its assumption by the purchaser. <p>Authorizes the holder to make an immediate demand of all loan principal if the loan assumption is  not approved or a timely appeal is not made of such decision by the transferor. Authorizes the holder also to make such a demand if the veteran disposes of the property without notifying the holder of such transfer.  Requires any loan holder who has knowledge of a property transfer by a veteran to notify the Administrator of such transfer (or impending transfer).  Holds the holder liable for any damage resulting from his or her failure to so inform the Administrator.  Requires the Administrator to ensure that each contract entered into with a veteran under a guaranteed-loan arrangement contains provisions implementing such requirements.  Requires the Administrator to establish a reasonable charge for the processing of a creditworthiness determination or loan assumption application. <p>Requires any guaranteed VA housing loan to include a provision which states that the loan is immediately due and payable upon transfer of the property securing such loan to a transferee whose creditworthiness is not established as required. Authorizes the collection of a loan fee from the person assuming the loan. <p>Requires appraisers in the VA home loan guaranty program to:  (1) successfully complete a written examination; (2) submit a sample appraisal; (3) certify to an appropriate number of years of experience as an appraiser; and (4) submit recommendations from other appraisers. <p>Requires an appraiser approved by the Administrator to forward an appraisal report to the Administrator for review, at which time the Administrator shall determine the reasonable value of the property and notify the veteran of such determination. Authorizes the Administrator to allow certain approved lenders to make such appraisals on their own.  Directs the appraiser in such a case to forward the appraisal report directly to the lender for review, and the lender, as soon as possible thereafter, to furnish a copy of the appraisal to the veteran who is applying for the loan and the Administrator. Directs the Administrator to carry out an appraisal review monitoring system to monitor the effectiveness of the determination of reasonable value made by such approved lenders. <p>Exempts the veterans' guaranteed home loan program from sequestration procedures under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act). Repeals a requirement that the President make certain monthly reports to specified congressional committees following cancellation of such loan guarantee commitments in certain circumstances. <p>Revises provisions concerning the determination of minimum residual income for purposes of a veteran's eligibility for a VA-guaranteed home loan. <p>Directs the Administrator, in order to effect the most expeditious sale, at the best possible price, of property acquired as the result of a guaranteed loan default, to list such property with real estate brokers."

Rept. 100-578) <p>Veterans' Benefits and Services Act of 1988 - <b>Title I:  Health-Care Programs - Part A:  Benefits</b> - Amends Federal veterans' benefits provisions to require (currently, authorizes) the Administrator of Veterans Affairs to furnish, on an outpatient or ambulatory basis, needed medical services to a veteran for any service-connected disability, or for any disability of a veteran having a service-connected disability rating of 50 percent or more.  Requires the Administrator to provide such services to any veteran receiving benefits due to being disabled during treatment or vocational rehabilitation.  Repeals provisions authorizing the Administrator to provide necessary home health services to such veterans. Directs the Administrator to furnish (on an outpatient or ambulatory basis) medical services to any veteran who:  (1) has a service-connected disability rating of either 30 or 40 percent; and (2) is eligible for hospital care and whose annual income does not exceed the maximum annual rate of pension that would be applicable to the veteran if the veteran were currently eligible for such pension. <p>Authorizes the Administrator to furnish, on an ambulatory or outpatient basis, needed medical services to any veteran:  (1) who is in receipt of increased pension or additional compensation based on the need of regular aid and attendance or by reason of being permanently housebound; (2) who is a former prisoner of war; (3) of the Mexican border period or of World War I; or (4) who is eligible for hospital care under current veterans' benefits provisions.  Defines medical services as those reasonably necessary in preparation for hospital admission or to obviate the need of hospital admission.  Defines medical services for purposes of veterans who have been furnished hospital, nursing home, or domiciliary care.  Prohibits such services from being provided for a period in excess of 12 months after the veteran is discharged from such care. Revises the priority among specified veterans for the receipt of outpatient services.  Authorizes the Administrator to furnish such home health services, as part of necessary outpatient or ambulatory services, as deemed necessary or appropriate for the effective and economical treatment of the veterans' disabilities.  Authorizes home improvements and structural alterations to be provided as part of such home services as necessary, while specifically limiting the maximum cost of such alterations or improvements. <p>Limits the eligibility for domiciliary care to veterans who have: (1) incomes at or below the pension aid-and-attendance level; or (2) no adequate means of support. <p>Revises the definition of ""nursing home care"" to include nursing care delivered in skilled, intermediate, and combined facilities and to exclude the provision of domiciliary care. <p>Authorizes the Veterans Administration (VA) to contract, on an inpatient or outpatient basis, for emergency care for veterans who have been placed in community nursing homes at VA expense, and for diagnostic services to determine eligibility for a VA benefit. <p>Authorizes the VA to furnish medical care outside the United States for the service-connected disability of a veteran who is in Canada, the Philippines, or, at the discretion of the Administrator, elsewhere. <p>Reduces from six months to 90 days the minimum internment period required for former prisoners of war to be eligible for outpatient dental care. <p>Repeals the current mandatory requirement for the transition from the provision of veterans' readjustment counseling services in facilities primarily set apart from health-care facilities operated by the VA to the provision of such services primarily through VA-operated facilities.  Requires the Administrator, after considering the recommendations of the Chief Medical Director of the VA, to submit to the Congress a national plan which sets forth plans with respect to each veterans center in existence on January 1, 1988, for not less than the next year as to its relocation to another VA facility, movement to another location, or closure, and which includes an evaluation of the ways in which decisions about each center would ensure the continued availability of readjustment counseling to persons eligible and needing such services in the geographical area served by such center. Requires the national plan to also include plans to open any new centers.  Prohibits any action from being taken with respect to any existing center prior to receipt of the national plan and for 120 days thereafter.  Specifies that, after the national plan is submitted, if the VA wishes to change its plans as to one or more centers, the Administrator must submit a revision of the national plan for centers in accordance with the same type of reporting requirements as apply to the initial plan, and to explain the basis for the changes in the plan.  Provides that no action outlined in any such revision may be implemented prior to 60 days after such plan revision. Provides that, once the plan is submitted, action may be taken as to the centers covered in the plan only in the way described in the plan or the plan revision.  Prohibits delegation of the Chief Medical Director's responsibility relating to the national plan.  Postpones by one year the due date of a report from the Administrator on the effectiveness of the readjustment counseling program in meeting the readjustment needs of the Vietnam-era veterans. <p>Provides that payments shall be made to eligible veterans traveling to or from a VA facility or other place for the following purposes: (1) scheduled care or examination; (2) outpatient care or admission to an inpatient health-care facility; (3) VA examination, treatment, or care; or (4) vocational rehabilitation. Provides that the following categories of veterans are eligible for such payments:  (1) veterans traveling for care in connection with a service-connected disability; (2) veterans with a service-connected disability rated at 30 percent or more; (3) veterans whose annual income does not exceed the maximum annual rate of pension which would be payable if the veterans were eligible for such pension; (4) veterans who are determined by the Administrator to be unable to defray the expenses of such travel; (5) veterans receiving a pension; and (6) veterans traveling for the purpose of a compensation and pension examination. <p>Limits the amount that the Administrator may deduct from payments to a person required to make six or more one-way trips during any month.

Sets a maximum deductible of $22.50 per month for veterans making six or more one-way trips during a calendar month or months. Provides that no such deduction shall be taken in the case of a person whose travel to a VA facility was either required to be performed by a special mode of travel which was authorized beforehand by the Administrator, or was in connection with a medical emergency where delay caused by prior authorization by the Administrator would have been hazardous to such person's life or health. Authorizes the Administrator to waive the required deduction in the case of the travel of any veteran for whom the imposition of the deduction would cause severe financial hardship.  Authorizes the Administrator to increase (or decrease) proportionately the deductible amount whenever the amount of the reimbursement itself is increased or decreased. <p>Directs the Administrator, with respect to any fiscal year in which he or she exercises authority to make such payments, to allocate funds to each VA facility to enable its head to make such payments to veterans using it and authorized to receive such payments. Directs the head of each such facility to use such funds solely to make such reimbursement payments. <p>Directs the Chief Medical Director of the VA's Department of Medicine and Surgery (the CMD), whenever it is determined that less than the maximum payments authorized have been made at any such facility, to allow, on April 12, 1987, at the facility's request, payments at less than the authorized maximum if it would be in the best interest of furnishing care and services to eligible veterans there.  Permits the use of any funds authorized for such payments, but unexpended, for direct patient-care services. <p>Directs the Administrator to facilitate the establishment of a program under which volunteer organizations or individuals would take responsibility for the transportation of such veterans, without reimbursement from the VA, to VA facilities for services and benefits.  Directs the Administrator, no later than six months after the enactment of the above provisions, to report to the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees on the implementation of such program. <p><b>Title II:  Quality Assurance Program</b> - Establishes in the Office of the CMD of the Department an Office of Medical Inspector General (MIG). Makes the MIG directly responsible to the CMD, and requires him or her to review, monitor, and investigate any adverse incident which is experienced by a patient during the course of care in a VA health-care facility, including any incident that would not normally be considered a natural consequence of the patient's disease or illness and any incident that would carry a recognized need for medical intervention.  Authorizes the MIG to also review and investigate matters he or she considers necessary to identify problems in the provision of health care to veterans and propose any corrective measures to the CMD.  States that the MIG shall have sole discretion in determining whether to investigate any incident involving patient care or to study or review any problem in the provision of health care to veterans. <p>Directs the MIG to submit a report, no later than February 1, annually, to the Administrator of Veterans Affairs, the CMD, and the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees on the activities of the Office under this Act during the preceding fiscal year. <p>Requires the MIG to be an ex officio, nonvoting member of all policymaking bodies within the central office of the Department that are concerned with the quality of health care provided in VA facilities or that are concerned with quality assurance in the provision of such care. Denies the MIG, however, any direct responsibility for quality assurance activities. <p>Directs the Administrator to transfer to the Office funds necessary to support five full-time medical doctors and five full-time support personnel. <p>Requires that, in the Office of the CMD, one of the Assistant Chief Medical Directors shall be a qualified physician trained in or having suitable experience in health-care quality assurance and risk management.  Makes such Assistant Director responsible to the CMD for carrying out responsibilities in such areas. <p>Requires the CMD to ensure that all personnel of the Department:  (1) are periodically given an explanation of their quality assurance responsibilities in such Department; and (2) are advised that any failure to comply with quality assurance procedures within the Department will result in appropriate disciplinary action. <p>Establishes in the VA's office of the Inspector General the position of the Assistant Inspector General for Health Care Quality Assurance Review (the AIG).  Requires the AIG to be a qualified doctor of medicine appointed by the Inspector General of the VA. Outlines various duties and responsibilities of the Assistant Inspector, all of which relate to the monitoring, review, and appropriate investigations of incidents involving quality assurance of health-care services to veterans and its related functions within the Department. <p>Directs the Inspector General of the VA, no later than February 1 annually, to submit to the Administrator of Veterans Affairs and the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees a report containing:  (1) a discussion of the activities, conclusions, and recommendations of the AIG concerning corrective action required in the Department relating to the quality of health care provided to veterans; and (2) a discussion of the activities undertaken by the AIG to monitor the Medical Inspector of the VA during the preceding fiscal year, and the AIG's findings, conclusions, assessment, and recommendations based on such monitoring, including any possible remedial and disciplinary actions. <p><b>Title III:  Vietnam Veterans' Readjustment Counseling Programs</b> - Expands eligibility for veterans' readjustment counseling and related mental health services (currently available only to Vietnam veterans) to include any veteran or person who served on active duty after May 7, 1975, in an area during a period in which hostilities occurred.  Also authorizes such services, upon request, to any veteran who served on active duty during World War II or the Korean Conflict. Requires such assistance to include an assessment of whether the person or veteran has mental or psychological problems associated with such individual's active service. <p>Requires that professional, paraprofessional, and lay personnel trained to provide readjustment counseling services for veterans, and who complete two years of continuous employment in such training program and are still so employed on the 90th day following the enactment of this provision, shall be converted to a career-conditional or career employment status within a specified conditional period after the completion of such training.  Directs the Administrator, no later than 15 days after an individual becomes eligible for such employment position conversion, to notify such individual of such entitlement and the timetable for such employee's conversion. <p>Prohibits any Vet Center in existence on July 1, 1987, from being closed or relocated unless the CMD:  (1) determines that such closure or relocation will not adversely affect readjustment counseling services to eligible persons in the geographical area served by such center; (2) ensures that certain requirements outlined later in this Act are met; and (3) provides notice to the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees, at least 60 day prior to such a closure or relocation.  Outlines various factors to be given consideration by the CMD when determining whether such a closure or relocation is appropriate, including the distribution of Vietnam-era veterans in areas served by a center, distances required for travel to such center, personnel acceptability of such closures or relocations, the availability of other entities to provide such services, and so forth. <p>Provides that, in the event of a relocation of a Vet Center to a general VA facility, no less than the average annual budget and personnel ceiling provided to the Center in each of the three fiscal years prior to such move will remain available to furnish readjustment counseling services for two full fiscal years following such relocation.

Requires the Directors and Assistant Directors to conduct annual evaluations and make recommendations, as appropriate, concerning each employment office and services provided. <p>Revises certain responsibilities of DVOPSs under the Job Training Partnership Act and the Veterans' Job Training Act, in light of changes made under this Act. <p>Directs the Secretary, in order to provide training for the efficient and effective provision of employment, job training, placement, and related services to veterans, to establish and fund a National Veterans' Employment and Training Service Institute for the training of DVOPSs, LVERs, State Directors and Assistant Directors for Veterans' Employment and Training, and other appropriate personnel. <p>Directs the Secretary, through the Bureau of Labor Statistics, to conduct, on a biennial basis, studies of unemployment among special disabled veterans and among veterans who served in the Vietnam theater of operations, and promptly report to the Congress the results of such studies.  Requires the first such study to be completed no later than July 1, 1988. <p>Adds to the membership of the Secretary of Labor's Committee on Veterans' Employment the representatives of the Secretary of Education and the Postmaster General. <p>Amends the Veterans' Job Training Act to expand the eligibility criteria for veterans participating in job training programs under such Act by eliminating the requirement that service must have been performed during the Korean Conflict or during the Vietnam era only, and by eliminating a period-of-unemployment requirement for veterans who are unemployed as a result of plant closings or major reductions in employment by an employer and who have no realistic opportunity for the same or similar employment in the same geographical area. <p>Requires the Administrator and the Secretary to jointly provide for a program under which a DVOPS is assigned as a case manager to each veteran participating in a job training program, the veteran has an in-person interview with the case manager no later than 60 days after entering into such a program, and periodic contact is maintained with each such veteran by his or her case manager.  Requires the Administrator and the Secretary to jointly provide for:  (1) a program of counseling services designed to resolve difficulties that may be encountered by veterans during their job training; and (2) a program of information services to provide information to the veteran participant relating to support services available to such veteran in counseling and career development. Waives the requirement of the assignment of a case manager for each veteran employee of an employer in certain instances.  Requires a veteran who is unsuccessful in completing a job training program to be provided with appropriate vocational counseling by the Administrator before receiving a new certificate authorizing such veteran to participate in another job training program under the Veterans' Job Training Act (VJTA). <p>Provides that if the Secretary determines that the rates of veterans' successful completion of an employer's VJTA program are disproportionately low, then the Administrator must disapprove participation in the employer's job training programs of veterans who have not begun participation on the date that the employer is notified of the disapproval.  Requires the employer to be given notice of the disapproval.  Provides that such a disapproval shall remain in effect until such time as the Administrator determines that adequate remedial action has been taken by the employer to correct the situation.  Provides that if the Administrator finds that actions taken by an employer, together with formula payments made to an employer for their participation in a VJTA program, are sufficient to ensure future avoidance of a disproportionately low rate, then the Administrator would be authorized to revoke the disapproval, conditioned upon the use of the payment formula for a period of time considered appropriate by the Administrator under the circumstances.  Provides the payment formula to be used, which would vary depending upon the length of the job training program in question. <p>Amends the VJTA to extend the authorization of appropriations under such Act through FY 1989, and the availability of such authorized appropriations through FY 1991.  Provides that any funds obligated for the purpose of making payments to employers under a VJTA program which are later deobligated would become immediately available to the Administrator for reobligation for VJTA payments, without the possibility of any officer or employee in the executive branch delaying the reobligation of such funds. <p>Postpones until June 30, 1989 (currently, July 2, 1987) the deadline for eligible veterans to apply for participation in a VJTA program, and postpones until December 31, 1989 (currently, January 2, 1988) the deadline for entering training under such a program. <p>Directs the Secretary, on a not less frequent than quarterly basis, to collect from State employment agencies and from the State Directors for Veterans' Employment and Training specified information concerning veterans receiving counseling under, participating in, completing, or failing to complete VJTA-sponsored job training programs."

Requires State programs to:  (1) provide for repayment of loans; (2) establish minimum standards for the designation of areas in which individuals will perform obligated service, or provide for the use of areas designated by the Secretary; and (3) establish minimum standards for the determination of obligated service.  Prohibits the Federal share of any such State program from exceeding 75 percent.

States that a claimant has the burden of submitting sufficient evidence to justify a claim, and that if an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence exists regarding the merits of a claim, the VA is to resolve such doubt in favor of the claimant. <p>States that VA subpoenas may be served either by personal delivery or by registered or certified mail. <p>Requires the chairman of the Board of Veterans' Appeals to submit an annual report to the appropriate congressional committees concerning the Board's current handling of cases and projections for the subsequent fiscal year. <p>Requires the Board to:  (1) provide notice to a claimant and an opportunity for a hearing before a decision may be based on ""additional official information"" received after a Board decision has previously been made; and (2) make its decision exclusively on evidence and material of record in the proceeding. <p>Removes the requirement that new material sufficient to allow the Board to reopen a previously disallowed claim be in the form of official reports. <p>Provides that the Board's discretionary authority to reopen a claim will not be diminished by a judicial decision following an appeal as provided for by this Act. <p>Requires the Board to mail to the claimant notice of its decision and the reasons for such decision. <p>Provides that, upon the request of a claimant, the Board shall provide an independent advisory medical opinion when there exists substantial medical disagreement with respect to a material issue in a veteran's appeal. <p>Sets forth new procedural rules for adjudication hearings regarding:  (1) oaths, affirmations, and witness examination; (2) admissibility of evidence; (3) procedural rights of claimants; (4) disqualification of a hearing officer; (5) the record of the proceedings and the claimant's right to examine and obtain a copy of such record; and (6) the exclusiveness of veterans' adjudication procedures and rights prescribed by the Administrator. <p>Requires the Administrator to provide at each stage of the appeal proceedings written notice to a claimant of the claimant's procedural rights. <p>Directs the Administrator to conduct a study of two alternative claims resolution methods:  one, a new intermediate-level adjudication process; the other, an enhanced schedule of formal Appeals Board hearings.  Directs the Administrator to report to the Congress on such studies. <p><b>Title II:  Veterans Administration Rule Making</b> - Includes the VA's rulemaking procedures under the relevant provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act. <p><b>Title III:  Judicial Review</b> - Provides for judicial review of VA decisions in the Federal court system. <p>States, with regard to jurisdiction:  (1) the definition of final decision; (2) that judicial review of a final decision in a claim for benefits may be obtained in a civil action brought within 180 days of the Board's mailing of notice of its decision, and that such action shall be brought in Federal district court; (3) that the VA shall file the various materials constituting the record in a case together with its answer to the claimant's complaint; (4) that the court may render a decision on the pleadings; and (5) that the judicial review procedures established under this Act shall not apply to insurance and home loans. <p>States, with regard to the reviewing court's scope of review, that such court:  (1) shall decide questions of law and interpret constitutional, statutory, and regulatory provisions, but that questions of fact (unless unsupported by substantial evidence) will not be subject to a trial de novo; and (2) in reviewing a final decision of the VA which is adverse to a party solely because such party failed to comply with VA procedures, may only review questions concerning such procedures. <p>Sets out provisions regarding remand, survival of actions, and appellate review. <p><b>Title IV:  Attorneys' Fees</b> - Authorizes the Administrator to allow attorneys' fees above the present $10 maximum if the appealing party's claim is allowed by the VA after an initial denial.  States that such fee shall be the lesser of: (1) the fee agreed upon by the party and attorney; (2) $500, unless the Administrator approves a greater amount; or (3) if the party and attorney have entered into a contingent-fee agreement, not more than 25 percent of the total of any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of such party's claim. <p>Provides for the approval of attorneys' fees in successful veterans' claims brought before a court as provided for under this Act.  States that such fees shall be determined by such court, and in contingent-fee agreements such fees shall not exceed 25 percent of the total of any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of such claim. Authorizes attorneys' fees of up to $750 in certain unsuccessful veterans' claims. <p>Prohibits the VA from authorizing payment to a claimant's attorney based on past-due benefits unless such benefits are owed as of the date of the VA's or a court's award. <p>States that such provisions regarding attorneys' fees shall only apply to claims for benefits under the laws administered by the VA and shall not apply in cases in which the VA is the plaintiff or in which other attorneys' fees statutes are otherwise controlling. <p><b>Title V:  Effective Dates</b> - Sets forth the effective dates for this Act."

Makes similar changes in the denominator of the ratio to be used in determining the amount of a direct loan to a veteran for the purchase or construction of a home.  Exempts such veterans' home loan guaranty provisions from sequestration procedures under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act), and repeals a Federal provision requiring the President to make certain reports to congressional committees following a cancellation of such loan guarantee commitments. <p>Removes the requirement that a veteran must own and occupy a dwelling or residence in order for such veteran to qualify for a VA-guaranteed loan on such dwelling.  Allows such dwelling or residence to qualify for such loan guarantee if the veteran concerned certifies that he or she has previously so occupied it.  Prohibits the amount of any such VA-guaranteed loan from exceeding 90 percent of the appraised value of the dwelling or farm residence which will secure the loan.  Makes identical changes to provisions providing VA-guaranteed loans to purchase manufactured homes and lots.  Revises provisions relating to the procedures used for ascertaining the monthly income required by the veteran to meet the anticipated loan payment terms. <p>Directs the Administrator of Veterans Affairs, within a reasonable time after receiving proper notice, to provide veterans with information and counseling regarding:  (1) alternatives to foreclosure of a VA-guaranteed loan; (2) the VA's and the veteran's liabilities with respect to the loan in the event of foreclosure; and (3) the availability of counseling concerning such matters.  Requires the Administrator to ensure sufficient personnel to provide such counseling. <p>Revises the definition of ""total indebtedness"" for purposes of the liquidation of loans in default.  Provides that, in any case where there is a substantial delay in the liquidation sale caused by the loan holder's exercising forbearance at the Administrator's request, the date for determining the total indebtedness of the veteran shall be a date specified by the Administrator between the date forebearance is requested and the date of actual liquidation sale (i.e., the veteran, and not the holder of the loan, shall be responsible for any extra charges or interest accrued on the loan because of such delayed liquidation date).  Authorizes the Administrator to specify a sale liquidation date only if the Administrator is authorized to accept conveyance of the property on such date.  Requires that, in any other case in which there is a delay in such liquidation sale beyond a reasonable period for such sale, the liquidation date (for purposes of determining total indebtedness) shall be the earliest date on which such ""reasonable period for sale"" expires. <p>Amends the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 and other Federal law to extend from October 1, 1987, through FY 1988 provisions which:  (1) provide for determining whether the VA may acquire properties at liquidation sales; and (2) determine the proportion of such acquired properties that the VA may sell for cash. <p>Prohibits the amount of a loan made by the Administrator to finance the purchase of real property from the VA (property acquired through default proceedings) from exceeding 90 percent of the purchase price. Authorizes the payment of a 2.5 percent loan fee to the Administrator by those purchasing real property from the Administrator which was acquired by default. <p>Increases the authorized percentage of cash sales of properties acquired by the Administrator through foreclosures.  Extends until October 1, 1999, the authorized period for such sales. <p>Provides that, in the event of default of a loan, if the Administrator refuses to accept a voluntary offer by the veteran to accept the property securing the loan, the Administrator may not include in the amount of such veteran's liability in connection with the loan the cost of a foreclosure proceeding. Provides that a veteran's voluntary conveyance of the property securing the loan shall not release the veteran from any other liability to the Administrator. <p>Prohibits any person from assuming a guaranteed or insured housing loan obtained by a veteran unless, prior to the assumption, the veteran notifies the holder of the loan in writing and the acceptability of the assumption is established under specified procedures. Provides that, if the acceptability of  such loan assumption is established, the loan obligor shall be relieved of all further liability to the Administrator, unless the Administrator determines that such release would not be in the best interest of the solvency of the Loan Guaranty Revolving Fund and promptly so notifies the veteran.  Provides that, in the case of a sale of the property securing a loan, unless the acceptability of an assumed loan is established, payment in full of all appropriate charges under the terms of the loan shall be immediately due from the loan obligor on the date of transfer of title by the obligor. <p>Directs the Administrator, upon notification by the veteran of a loan assumption, to provide a written explanation of the veteran's rights and liabilities under such proposed assumption. <p>Provides that if a veteran disposes of real property securing a VA-guaranteed loan and fails to notify the loan holder before the property is disposed of, payment in full shall be immediately due and payable to the holder by the veteran at any time beginning on the date of the transfer. Provides that if the holder has knowledge of a transfer of title by the loan obligor, the holder shall immediately notify the Administrator of such transfer.  Provides that a holder with such knowledge who fails to notify the Administrator shall be liable to the Administrator for any damage sustained as a result of such failure. Requires that any legal papers concerning the VA-guaranteed loan shall include, in conspicuous letters, a statement to the effect that such loan is not assumable without the approval of the VA or its authorized agent. <p>Defines the term ""obligor"" as the person owning a guaranteed or insured loan who is either: (1) the veteran who originally obtained the loan; or (2) a person who acquired the loan under the loan assumption acceptability provisions previously outlined in this Act. <p>Requires that a VA-guaranteed loan include a provision that the loan is immediately due and payable upon transfer of the property to a transferee unless the acceptability of the assumption is established in accordance with earlier provisions of this Act.  Authorizes the payment of a fee of one-half percent of the loan balance to be charged to any person assuming a VA-guaranteed loan.  Requires the Administrator to promulgate regulations concerning maximum amounts a lender may charge for processing applications for credit worthiness determinations and loan assumptions. <p>Limits to 95 percent of the purchase price of the property securing the loan the amount of any loan that is to be paid by the veteran purchasing a manufactured home. <p>Authorizes the Administrator to contract for such supplementary services and equipment as necessary to ensure the long-term stability of the Loan Guaranty Revolving Fund.  Outlines the supplemental services involved, including the use of loan-service companies, accounting firms, real estate brokers, and other contractors.  Directs the Administrator to use funds obtained through loan fees and loan assumption fees to procure such supplemental services.  Adds additional funds to such available amounts for FY 1988 and 1989. <p>Extends through FY 1989 the authority for the collection of a loan fee. <p>Directs real estate appraisers appraising property for which a VA-guaranteed loan is being considered to forward an appraisal report to the Administrator for review.  Directs the Administrator to then determine the reasonable value of the property, and any construction or alterations necessary, and notify the veteran. Authorizes the Administrator  to allow a lender authorized to make loans which are automatically guaranteed by the VA to determine the reasonable value of such property.  Requires the appraiser, in such a case, to submit the appraisal report directly to the lender for review, and the lender, as soon as practicable thereafter, to furnish a copy of such report to the veteran who is applying for the loan and to the Administrator. Directs the Administrator, prior to exercising such authority, to establish a random appraisal-review system, to be performed by contract personnel paid from the Loan Guaranty Revolving Fund. <p>Directs the Administrator, in order to effect the most expeditious sale of property acquired as the result of a guaranteed loan default, and at the best possible price, to list such property with real estate brokers. <p>Repeals Federal law which generally precludes the VA from selling without recourse any loan it makes to finance the sales of foreclosed properties it has acquired."

(Current law imposes such duties on the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) and agency heads but not on the President.)  Specifies that such requirement shall not be construed as:  (1) requiring the approval of the intelligence committees to initiate such activities; or (2) limiting the President's powers conferred by the Constitution to initiate such activities. <p>Requires the President to ensure that any illegal intelligence activity is reported to the intelligence committees, as well as any corrective action taken or planned in connection with such illegal activity. (Current law imposes this duty only on the DCI and agency heads, subject to certain conditions.) <p>Provides statutory authority for the President to authorize special activities only when he determines such activities are necessary to support U.S. foreign policy objectives and are important to national security.  (Current law does not provide express statutory authorization for special activities.)  Requires that such determination be set forth in a finding that meets the following conditions:  (1) each finding must be in writing, unless immediate action is required and time does not permit a written finding (in which case a written record of the President's decision would have to be contemporaneously made and reduced to a written finding as soon as possible but not later than 48 hours after the decision is made); (2) each finding must specify each Government entity authorized to fund or otherwise participate significantly in such special activities; and (3) each finding must specify any third party not subject to Government regulations who will be used to fund or otherwise participate in a special activity. Prohibits a finding from:  (1) authorizing any action which violates the Constitution or any statutes of the United States; (2) authorizing or sanctioning special activities which have already occurred; or (3) authorizing any action intended to influence U.S. political processes, public opinion policies, or media. <p>Requires the President to ensure that any such finding be reported to the intelligence committees as soon as possible, but no later than 48 hours after it has been signed.  Allows the President, on occasions when time is of the essence, to direct that special activities be initiated prior to reporting such activities to the intelligence committees, provided that notice is provided to the intelligence committees as soon as possible but in no event later than 48-hours after the finding authorizing such activities is signed or the determination to conduct such activities is made. <p>Allows the President, in extraordinary circumstances, to limit the reporting of such findings or determinations to the chairmen and ranking minority members of the intelligence committees, the Speaker and minority leader of the House of Representatives, and the majority and minority leaders of the Senate, but requires that he provide a statement of the reasons for limiting access.  Authorizes the President to limit the reporting of findings or determinations to the Speaker and the minority leader of the House of Representatives and the majority and minority leaders of the Senate when he determines that the risk of disclosure constitutes a grave risk to vital U.S. security interests, but requires that he provide a monthly statement explaining why notice to the intelligence committees is not being provided.  Subjects such information to the provisions of S. Res. 400, 94th Congress and to rule XLVII of the Rules of the House of Representatives (which restricts the disclosure of covert operation information). <p>Requires the President to promptly notify the intelligence committees or, if applicable, the Members of Congress specified of any significant change in any previously-approved special activities. <p>Defines ""special activity"" to mean:  (1) any operation of the Central Intelligence Agency conducted in foreign countries, other than activities intended solely for obtaining necessary intelligence; and (2) any activity conducted by any Government entity in support of national foreign policy objectives abroad which is planned and executed so that the Government's role is not apparent or acknowledged publicly, excluding diplomatic activities or the collection and production of intelligence or related support activities. <p>Prohibits the use of U.S. funds for any special activity unless and until a presidential finding has been signed or otherwise issued in accordance with this Act."

Sets a maximum deductible amount of $22.50 per month for veterans making six or more one-way trips during a calendar month or months. Provides that no such deduction shall be taken in the case of a person whose travel to a VA facility was either required to be performed by a special mode of travel which was authorized beforehand by the Administrator, or was in connection with a medical emergency where delay caused by prior authorization by the Administrator would have been hazardous to such person's life or health.  Authorizes the Administrator to waive the required deduction in the case of the travel of any veteran for whom the imposition of the deduction would cause severe financial hardship. Authorizes the Administrator to increase (or decrease) proportionately the deductible amount whenever the amount of the reimbursement itself is increased or decreased. <p>Directs the Administrator, with respect to any fiscal year in which he or she exercises authority to make such payments, to allocate funds to each VA facility to enable its head to make such payments to veterans using it and authorized to receive such payments. Directs the head of each such facility to use such funds solely to make such reimbursement payments. <p>Directs the Chief Medical Director of the VA's Department of Medicine and Surgery (the CMD), whenever it is determined that less than the maximum payments authorized have been made at any such facility, to allow, on April 12, 1987, at the facility's request, payment at less than the authorized maximum if it would be in the best interest of furnishing care and services to eligible veterans there.  Permits the use of any funds authorized for such payments, but unexpended, for direct patient-care services. <p>Directs the Administrator to facilitate the establishment of a program under which volunteer organizations or individuals would take responsibility for the transportation of such veterans, without reimbursement from the VA, to VA facilities for services and benefits.  Directs the Administrator, no later than six months after the enactment of the above provisions, to report to the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees on the implementation of such program. <p><b>Title II:  Quality Assurance Program</b> - Establishes in the Office of the CMD of the Department an Office of Medical Inspector General (MIG). Makes the MIG directly responsible to the CMD, and requires him or her to review, monitor, and investigate any adverse incident which is experienced by a patient during the course of care in a VA health-care facility, including any incident that would not normally be considered a natural consequence of the patient's disease or illness and any incident that would carry a recognized need for medical intervention.  Authorizes the MIG to also review and investigate matters he or she considers necessary to identify problems in the provision of health care to veterans and propose any corrective measures to the CMD. States that the MIG shall have sole discretion in determining whether to investigate any incident involving patient care or to study or review any problem in the provision of health care to veterans. <p>Directs the MIG to submit a report, no later than February 1 annually, to the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs, the CMD, and the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees on the activities of the Office under this Act during the preceding fiscal year. <p>Requires the MIG to be an ex officio, nonvoting member of all policymaking bodies within the central office of the Department that are concerned with the quality of health care provided in VA facilities or that are concerned with quality assurance in the provision of such care. Denies the MIG, however, any direct responsibility for quality assurance activities. <p>Directs the Administrator to transfer to the Office funds necessary to support five full-time medical doctors and five full-time support personnel. <p>Requires that, in the Office of the CMD, one of the Assistant Chief Medical Directors shall be a qualified physician trained in or having suitable experience in health-care quality assurance and risk management.  Makes such Assistant Director responsible to the CMD for carrying out responsibilities in such areas. <p>Requires the CMD to ensure that all personnel of the Deparment:  (1) are periodically given an explanation of their quality assurance responsibilities in such Department; and (2) are advised that any failure to comply with quality assurance procedures within the Department will result in appropriate disciplinary action. <p>Establishes in the VA's office of the Inspector General the position of the Assistant Inspector General for Health Care Quality Assurance Review (the AIG).  Requires the AIG to be a qualified doctor of medicine appointed by the Inspector General of the VA. Outlines various duties and responsibilities of the AIG, all of which relate to the monitoring, review, and appropriate investigations of incidents involving quality assurance of health-care services to veterans and its related functions within the Department. <p>Directs the Inspector General of the VA, no later than February 1 annually, to submit to the Administrator of Veterans Affairs and the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees a report containing:  (1) a discussion of the activities, conclusions, and recommendations of the AIG concerning corrective action required in the Department relating to the quality of health care provided to veterans; and (2) a discussion of the activities undertaken by the AIG to monitor the Medical Inspector of the VA during the preceding fiscal year, and the AIG's findings, conclusions, assessment, and recommendations based on such monitoring, including any possible remedial and disciplinary actions. <p><b>Title III:  Vietnam Veterans' Readjustment Counseling Programs</b> - Expands eligibility for readjustment counseling and related mental health services (currently available only to Vietnam veterans) to include any veteran or person who served on active duty after May 7, 1975, in an area during a period in which hostilities occurred. Also authorizes such services, upon request, to any veteran who served on active duty during World War II or the Korean Conflict. Requires such assistance to include an assessment of whether the person or veteran has mental or psychological problems associated with such individual's active service. <p>Requires that professional, paraprofessional, and lay personnel trained to provide readjustment counseling services for veterans, and who complete two years of continuous employment in such training program and are still so employed on the 90th day following the enactment of this provision, shall be converted to a career-conditional or career employment status within a specified conditional period after the completion of such training.  Directs the Administrator, no later than 15 days after an individual becomes eligible for such employment position conversion, to notify such individual of such entitlement and the timetable for such employee's conversion. <p>Prohibits any Vet Center in existence on July 1, 1987, from being closed or relocated unless the CMD: (1) determines that such closure or relocation will not adversely affect readjustment counseling services to eligible persons in the geographical area served by such center; (2) ensures that certain requirements outlined later in this Act are met; and (3) provides notice to the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees at least 60 days prior to such a closure or relocation.  Outlines various factors to be considered by the CMD when determining whether such a closure or relocation is appropriate, including the distribution of Vietnam-era veterans in areas served by a center, distances required for travel to such center, personnel acceptability of such closures or relocations, the availability of other entities to provide such services, and so forth. <p>Provides that, in the event of a relocation of a Vet Center to a general VA facility, no less than the average annual budget and personnel ceiling provided to the Center in each of the three fiscal years prior to such move will remain available to furnish readjustment counseling services for two full fiscal years following such relocation.  Authorizes the CMD to reduce such budget and personnel ceiling levels in appropriate circumstances and after appropriate congressional notification. <p>States that any proposed closure or relocation during any fiscal year after FY 1988 of more than ten percent of the Vet Centers in existence as of July 1, 1987, shall be deemed an administrative reorganization (requiring the submission to the Congress of a detailed plan and justification for such closure or relocation prior to such a move).  Prohibits any more than five percent of the Vet Centers in existence as of the above date from being closed or relocated prior to October 1, 1988. Requires the Administrator, in the event of an administrative reorganization as outlined above, to submit, in lieu of the detailed plan and justification required, a notification which includes information as to each Vet Center proposed to be closed or relocated and a justification for such reorganization. <p>Extends until April 1, 1988, the due date of a report from the Administrator to the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees on the effectiveness of providing sufficient readjustment counseling services to Vietnam-era veterans. <p>Authorizes the Vet Centers, in addition to providing readjustment counseling services, to provide other assistance (such as benefits application assistance) that the Administrator is authorized to furnish to such veterans. <p>Directs the Administrator, no later than 150 days after the enactment of this Act, to report to the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees on the implementation of VA readjustment counseling employee requirements as outlined in this Act. <p>Amends the Veterans' Health Care Amendments of 1983 to extend until October 1, 1987, the due date for a report from the Administrator to the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees concerning a study of post-traumatic stress disorder and other post-war psychological problems experienced by Vietnam veterans. <p>Prohibits any functions and authorities assigned to the Chief Medical Director by any provision of this Act from being delegated to or exercised by any other official."
