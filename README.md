# Democratus Concept

Democratus is a WIP project attempting to answer one simple question: Can we leverage the power of Generative AI to re-engage the general public in the democratic process?

The initial MVP concept includes the following features:
 - Allow a user to identify meaningful legislation according to their individual interests [Complete]
 - Issue a pre-determined prompt to a Gen AI provider (OpenAI initially) to summarize and surface the most relevant information [WIP]
 - Allow users to share summaries with others & contact their representative [Not Started]

The project is built using Flutter for cross-platform compatibility and rapid prototyping, as well as Firebase for backend storage and authentication.
The project leverages 3rd Party APIs for retrieving legislative data such as govinfo.gov and propublica
